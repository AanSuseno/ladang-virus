> Game HTML & Javascript

I am proud to present my game, "Ladang Virus". This game was created using Javascript and HTML during the pandemic in 2021, with the aim of providing entertainment and education to players.

In "Ladang Virus", players will play as a girl character who must collect as many diamonds as possible while avoiding the viruses that are spread throughout the game area. I hope players can feel the tension and excitement while playing this game. In addition, players must also collect health equipment that is scattered in the game area to increase their health, thus providing education on the importance of maintaining health during the pandemic.

I am very happy with the graphics i have created in this game, which will take players into an interesting and captivating game world. The game is easy to play and suitable for all ages, so it is expected to be enjoyed by many people.

I hope that with the presence of "Ladang Virus", it can provide useful entertainment and education for players. Thank you for playing my game!
